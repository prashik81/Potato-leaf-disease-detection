This project focuses on Potato Leaf Disease Detection, which aims to identify the type of diseases that affect the potato plant using image processing and machine learning. Early detection of plant disease is very important for maintaining healthy production and preventing losses.
The objective of this project is to develop a system that analyzes the image of potato leaves and   accurately tells what   disease the potato   plant   has.   In   this project, we have trained the model to identify whether the plant has late blight, Early blight disease. Methodology used: Collection of  datasets Preprocessing, Model training using CNNs, Performance metrics evaluation.
This project aims to contribute in modern farming by redusing manual inspection efforts, providing real-time disease detection and improve decision making for farmers.
In this project we used Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow and Google Colab/Jupiter Notebook for train and test the model.
It thus helps in precision farming since it facilitates early disease detection and helps farmers to take appropriate protection measures to improve plant quality.
By integrating machine learning into disease detection, this project aims to improve early detection and minimize the impact on plants. Such advancements will enhance accessibility and usability, making AI driven detection a valuable tool in modern agriculture.
